    "summary": "The strategic environment around potential U.S. drone, missile, or air strikes on Iranian soil in 2026 is acutely tense, with a large and ongoing U.S. force buildup, explicit strike threats from President Trump, and Iran signaling both readiness for nuclear-centered talks and willingness to retaliate harshly if attacked. Structural conditions—severely degraded IAEA verification, UN sanctions snapback, and an unusually violent domestic crackdown in Iran—have reduced diplomatic off-ramps and increased the system’s susceptibility to escalation once crises begin. \n\nIn the nearer term, Trump’s self-imposed nuclear-deal ultimatum, concentrated U.S. air assets in the region, and detailed public discussion of strike options all point to a credible U.S. capability and political willingness to consider limited strikes, even as negotiations via Oman continue. At the same time, the high risk of a region-wide war, competing U.S. global commitments, and ongoing indirect diplomacy are material constraints on initiating a new round of attacks on Iranian territory. Prediction-market pricing in a closely defined analogous contract suggests capital-weighted participants currently see a U.S. strike as more likely than not within the first half of 2026, but resolution remains highly path-dependent on a handful of catalysts.",
    "key_findings": [
      "The United States has substantially reinforced its military posture around Iran since late January 2026, including carrier strike groups, F‑15E deployments, and a reported massing of over 60 U.S. jets in Jordan, providing ready strike options on Iranian soil.",
      "President Trump has publicly issued a short (10–15 day) deadline for a nuclear deal and openly confirmed he is considering limited strikes, with credible media discussing potential target sets and large-scale first-strike capabilities.",
      "Iran, under intense domestic unrest and international condemnation for protest massacres, continues to insist on its right to enrichment, frames U.S. threats as psychological warfare, and warns that any U.S. attack would trigger decisive, region-wide retaliation.",
      "Nuclear verification gaps, UN sanctions snapback, and degraded signaling channels make 2026 structurally more escalation-prone, meaning limited incidents or miscalculations (e.g., drone encounters near U.S. carriers) could more easily spiral into direct interstate strikes.",
      "Active indirect diplomacy (notably nuclear-focused talks in Oman) and U.S. overextension in other global crises act as meaningful brakes on immediate escalation, but they coexist with highly public deterrent rhetoric that may be hard to walk back without some demonstrable outcome.",
      "A large, liquid prediction-market contract with a nearly identical definition currently prices a U.S. strike on Iran in 2026 above 50%, indicating that informed traders see a non-trivial—and arguably elevated—likelihood of the main event occurring."

      "summary": "Ali Khamenei, aged 86, remains Iran’s Supreme Leader as of late February 2026 and continues to be treated in reporting as the core decision-maker within a highly personalistic system. The institutional framework—centered on the Assembly of Experts—envisions succession primarily after death or clear incapacitation, not via mid-tenure removal, and there is no public sign that this body is preparing to depose him.\n\nAt the same time, Iran is undergoing an extreme regime crisis: the 2025–2026 protests have produced thousands to tens of thousands of deaths, directly target Khamenei in their slogans, and have drawn sharp UN condemnation and ongoing investigative mandates. These pressures, combined with Khamenei’s advanced age and longstanding health rumors, create a non-trivial medium-term risk of a transition via death or incapacitation by end-2026. However, the coercive apparatus (IRGC, Basij, security services) remains loyal and effective in repression, and there is no concrete evidence of an elite move to remove him or a coup-like process in train.\n\nExpert commentary generally frames succession as a realistic possibility within a “one-to-three-year” horizon, but expects it to be an elite-managed and orderly process aimed at preserving regime continuity—potentially with his son Mojtaba as a leading candidate—rather than a sudden ouster driven by protests. Historical precedent in Iran and comparable regimes suggests that even severe unrest and international isolation often do not produce leadership change at the very top in the short run.",

        "The 2025–2026 protests and massacres have produced extraordinarily high death tolls, explicit anti-Khamenei slogans, and strong UN Human Rights Council condemnation, signaling an acute legitimacy and human-rights crisis centered on his leadership.",
        "Despite the crisis, the IRGC and other security forces continue to follow central orders and execute large-scale repression, indicating that the coercive core of the regime remains cohesive rather than fracturing.",
        "The Assembly of Experts, constitutionally responsible for choosing or removing a Supreme Leader, shows no public sign of moving to dismiss Khamenei prematurely; open-source discussions portray succession as a post-Khamenei issue rather than an active deposition plan.",
        "Experts expect succession to be elite-managed and continuity-seeking, with figures like Mojtaba Khamenei seen as plausible heirs, and emphasize that there is no strong public or analytic consensus that Khamenei will be removed specifically within 2026."

      "summary": "By late February 2026, Khamenei remains firmly in office and publicly active, including issuing aggressive statements toward the United States, which underscores that he is still functioning as Iran’s top authority. The mechanisms that could make him “out” by June 30, 2026—death, incapacitation, formal removal by the Assembly of Experts, or explicit sidelining acknowledged by state institutions—show no visible signs of imminent activation.\n\nIran is nonetheless in an acute crisis: mass protests and the January 2026 massacres have driven unprecedented casualties and direct anti-Khamenei slogans, while UN bodies highlight extensive human-rights abuses, and international isolation is deepening. These pressures, combined with his age, create background risk that a political shock, security crisis, or health event could force rapid succession. However, the pattern of the regime’s behavior—effective repression, cohesive IRGC command, sustained information controls including a nationwide internet shutdown, and the absence of detectable elite splits—points toward short-term regime and leadership durability.\n\nMoreover, the market’s resolution standard—consensus of credible reporting—means that rumor-driven claims about health or palace intrigue are insufficient unless validated by multiple mainstream sources. Given the limited time window to June 30 and the historical pattern that Supreme Leader transitions in Iran have occurred only upon death and have been tightly controlled, the available evidence tilts toward continuity through mid-2026 rather than a near-term removal.",

Conversely, credible reports of Khamenei’s death or incapacitation could align with a U.S. preference to wait and test the new leadership’s stance before deciding on strikes, temporarily reducing strike likelihood, or—in a contested succession scenario—could increase fears of uncontrolled escalation and thus lower U.S. tolerance for nuclear risk, making pre-emptive strikes more thinkable."

Alternatively, news of a contested or hardline succession (e.g., elevation of Mojtaba Khamenei or an IRGC-favored figure) could convince U.S. planners that diplomatic openings are narrowing, increasing the perceived need to act quickly against nuclear or military targets while Iran is distracted. Conversely, continued indications that Khamenei is actively directing hardline responses to protests and nuclear issues reinforce the current pattern of brinkmanship, sustaining or raising the baseline risk of a U.S. strike within the window of active U.S. threats."
    }

  "synthesis": "The main event—whether the United States conducts a qualifying air, drone, or missile strike on Iranian soil or diplomatic facilities in 2026—sits at the junction of a rapidly militarizing U.S. posture, an internally embattled Iranian regime, and a degraded diplomatic and verification environment. U.S. carrier groups and strike aircraft are positioned for prompt operations, and President Trump has publicly imposed a near-term nuclear-deal deadline while openly entertaining limited strikes, signaling a genuine willingness to use force. In parallel, Iran’s leadership insists on maintaining enrichment under the NPT while warning that any attack will elicit a decisive, region-wide response, creating a high-stakes deterrence contest.\n\nWithin Iran, Ali Khamenei remains the pivotal actor at the center of this confrontation. He is both the regime’s core strategist in dealing with Washington and the principal architect of an extraordinarily violent crackdown on the 2025–2026 protests. That crackdown has severely tarnished the regime’s legitimacy, generated massive casualties, and triggered sustained UN scrutiny. Yet the security apparatus still obeys his directives, and constitutional as well as informal power structures are geared toward preserving continuity at the apex. The combination of his advanced age and the system’s stress raises the odds of a transition by the end of 2026, but there is no firm evidence of a short-term removal or coup, especially on the compressed timeline to mid-year.\n\nHow these leadership dynamics intersect with U.S. strike decisions is ambiguous. If Khamenei remains in firm control during Trump’s ultimatum period, both sides’ entrenched positions and the absence of easy diplomatic off-ramps support a continued high risk of limited U.S. strikes, particularly in response to perceived nuclear advances or lethal attacks on U.S. forces. Conversely, any sudden move toward succession—whether via health crisis, death, or internal reconfiguration—could temporarily depress the incentive for Washington to strike while the new leadership’s stance is tested, or, if the transition is chaotic or tilts toward even harder-line actors, could heighten U.S. fears of losing what it sees as a closing window to constrain Iran’s capabilities.\n\nPrediction-market prices and many expert assessments treat a direct U.S. strike as an elevated, though not preordained, outcome in this environment, reflecting genuine uncertainty about how near-term catalysts—Trump’s deadline, nuclear reports, protest trajectories, or unexpected leadership shocks—will unfold. At the same time, the very high escalation risk of a region-spanning conflict, the U.S. need to manage other global crises, and ongoing indirect negotiations all function as counterweights. The interplay between Khamenei’s durability, the cohesion of Iran’s coercive institutions, and U.S. domestic and strategic calculations will be central to determining whether the current crisis remains a deterrence standoff or crosses the threshold into new U.S. strikes on Iranian soil.\n\nOverall, the evidence supports viewing 2026 as a year of substantially heightened but still contingent risk: the structural conditions and capabilities for a U.S. strike are in place, and Khamenei’s contested but continuing rule keeps Iran on a collision course with Washington, yet multiple plausible paths remain for delaying or avoiding direct interstate attacks depending on how forthcoming diplomatic moves, internal Iranian stability, and nuclear-related intelligence develop.",
